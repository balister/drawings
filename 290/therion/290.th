#Cave Description
#This is a resurvey of the entrance series of fischgesicht down to the middle
#of the 3rd pitch. The entrance is a horizontal stoopway running roughly south.
#The ceiling is level, and the floor is covered in about half a meter of snow.
#Continuing south, you traverse across a small snow-plugged fissure, staying in
#the upper component of the passage to a conspicuous downclimb next to a 2m
#tall block of breakdown. Just after this climb, the traverse starts, with
#bolts on alternating walls leading you across breakdown blocks over a 20m
#canyon passage to the top of the first pitch. From the bottom of the first
#pitch, a large canyon passage heads north under the traverse; this is
#unsurveyed. A small crawlway blowing air heads to the south-east: this is
#the "twelve monkeys" region, which continues to Happy Butterfly Cave
#to the west, there is a 2m-high ledge, which is the top of the old 2nd pitch
#and the route of the original survey. We continued along the bolts at chest
#level to a previously snow-plugged hole to the south-west of the room, which
#is the new second pitch. This pitch is awkward due to 2 deviations at the top
#and drops you 10m to a tallus slope. To the south, under the ceiling ledge,
#is a tight parallel passage, but the main route is over the breakdown pile,
#down the 3m climb, across the step-across chasm with an ice plug (see QM4)
#and then down a series of short rebelays into the 30m 3rd pitch. Descend
#to the large breakdown block and spire about 20m from the bottom. The
#route deeper into the cave should be marked with reflectors from this point.

#Drop down 4m pitch. There are 3 holes, a pitch (p11) to the left into
#a large canyon, a steep descending rift climb down ahead, and to the
#right a shallower passage in the same plane. They all end up in the
#same canyon. Climbing down the middle route gets onto a large boulder
#wedeged in the top of the canyon, from where one can climb to the
#bottom of the p11 pitch. The passage to the right descends, then
#doubles back (short dead-end crawl off to right) to end up at a
#window looking out into the canyon.

#From where the p11 lands one can climb left into a traverse level in
#narrower rift. this can be followed 30m (and 14m down) to where it
#meets a small streamway in the back of the canyon. This ascends very
#steeply and can be followed for about 10m before becoming too tight.
#The same point can be reached by traversing higher up.  From near the
#lowest point you can drop down another level in the right and follow
#yet another traversable level until it gets too right.

#QM1	B	blitzen_to_LiquidLuck.2	-	After a roughly 2 m climb down, the passage spokes off to the left and slims down in size. Not very drafty but possibly links into the BBBBypass later on.
#QM2	B	blitzen_to_LiquidLuck.4	-	When in Benign bubble baby bypass, facing the formation, to your right ight is an awkward look crawl. Whilst investigate, this crawl leads into a drop, roughly 15 metres and would potientially link into the blitsen boulovard canyon.
#QM3	B	blitzen_to_LiquidLuck.25u	-	The Urinal is a fairly wet chamber, which is suspected to link into happy butterfly. West of the driping water inlet is a grotty, wet meander that would need crawling through. Dosent look nice... But could lead to a bigger water way.
#QM4	A	blitzen_to_LiquidLuck.25u	-	East of 25b is an aven that has a water inlet coming back into it. There is a strong possibilty that this is where happy butterfly could connect (nearest station is couldashhouldawouldatobathdodgersbypass.304)	

#------------
#Cave description  ;(leave commented-out)
#After traversing Blitzen boulovard for roughly 20m down stream, you come to a phreatic passage on the left had side above a slightly tricky climb. The start of this passage is 14C.Flowwing this passage onwards foe roughly 20m you reach a small chamber know as Benign Bubble Baby Bypass. So called due to the odd look formation suck in the corner. To the left of the formation you reach a pitch of 7m that drops into Piss Pot (so called due to how it was used during the exporlation of the meander). Piss Pot is roughly 15m in depth but ends in a bouldery choke, not worth any more exploration unless you fancy starting a dig. left of the pitch at station 7 is another meandering passage. Following this for roughly 15m you reach a pitch head which drops into Liquid Luck.
#Liquid Luck is a roughly 25m pitch head that drops onto a leadge, surrounded by canyon. The chamber is large and fairly drippy. Opposite this ledge is a phreatic passage that can be accesed by traverseing along liquide luck. The passage leads in a pitch head and a large chamber called the Urinal (also named due to its usage during exploration. The traverse above must be rigged and the decent is roughly 19m to the bottom, however the cieling extends by roughly 20m above the pitch head and is suspected to connect into happy butterfly, see QMR 3 and 4.

#Back at station 22 (the Liquid Luck Ledge), phreatic developement continues South East of station 22. Traverse along the phreatic passage, into another chamer, stay high and traverse along until you are across to into the contiuation of of the phre attic passage. This is the Begining of Freeattic_Flys

#QM1    A    FreeAttic_Flys.4TT		toto_to_crystalcrumble.1	Bottom of Toto,facing SW is a continuation of a meander, which leads into crystal crumble, Here you can find really impressive stalagites

#------------
#Cave description  ;(leave commented-out)
#Having finished the traverse out of liquid luck, you begin following the phreatic passage called Freeattic flys. So called because Lydia Leather is dyslxic and didnt realise it wasnt spelt that way. This passage continues along for 30m, passing intricate coral looking formation and it a continues rifting meandering passage. Eventually you get to a pitch head, that drops into a false floor 5m down. SE of the pitch is the continuation of Freattic flys known as the Odyssey.
#Dropping the second pitch puts you into Toto chamber, So called because of the boulder in the shape of Africa. Last station surveyed here is directly bellow the pitch head, has now been re visited to survey crystal crumble where stalagtites lie.

#QM1    A       ulysses_to_toto.1       ulysses_to_colericchamber.2  Opposite side of survey stationone on the other side of Ulysses sits a very obvious railway sized phreatic passage. To get through to this passage will require a traverse and bolt climb up into it. Very large draft and very promising as slapys to the end of Ulysses chamber sits at23.163, whilst splay into the railway passage is 48.85 (slay name:1->1u), so passage estmated to be 26 metres in width.
#QM2 	A	ulysses_to_toto.5	-  Passage sits behind the pitch bellow survey station 4. Would need to be bolted and dropped as falls in roughly 10-15 metres in depth. Promising meandering passage with minimal draft
#QM3	B	ulysses_to_toto.5	-  When facing the pitch bellow survey station 4, to your left with be a walking meandering passage, roughly a meter in width, with stable floor. minimal draft.
#QM4	C	ulysses_to_toto.8	-  Decending rift with wall on one side that is boulder choky (South), decending wall (North). Could go but would need to be done by someone who dosnt value there life.
#QM5	A	ulysses_to_toto.9	-  Small passage underneath a massive boulder choke but an extreamly large draft can be felt coming from said boulder choke. Whilst surveyed, it would need it be carefully crawld through in order to get into passage that sits behind, but again, needs someone who dosnt value there life to try it.
#QM6	A	ulysses_to_toto.15	-  Follows a meandering rift, roughly a metre in diametre and 2 metre in hieght, with anoth strong drafte flowing from station 15 to 14. Definatly worth exploring.

#------------
#Cave description
#Station 20 of ulysses_to_toto connects from the rebelay bolt of the higher level of Toto chamber. Instead of following the rigging down to Toto chamber, traverse along the higher level passage, following with the phreatic developement from freeattic_flys. This leads into a contiuation of the meandering/rifting/phreatic passage. Follow the passage with 2 small pitches no deeper than 10 metres. After the second pitch you arrive in Odius odium which continues both left and right. Following left will lead to a pitch (roughly 15m) which drops into the Shit Show. The chamber is made up of of false floor and massive boulder chokes, and is not an area to tread heavily. Seriously its shit. However as shit as it is, its drafting in multiple places. The chamber has not been excessively explored as of this surveys creation, but contiuse onworts NE and contiues to draft.

#Back in Odius Odium, turning right will lead you toward Ulysess. Ulysses is a very large chamber, roughly 20 metres in diameter, and a currently unknow depth but expected to be greater than 50 metre. The walls aroud the this chamber however is not great, infact its pretty crap. The day this survey was made, a traverse began to be rigged along the right side wall, with the intension of either A) traversing half way round the chamber and droping it to find the expected depth, or B) continuing to travese the chamber, in order to reach the strong lead on the oposite wall, which is a massive rail way sized, continuing phreatic tunnel. See QMR 1. This is still to be explored, however has strong draft facing SE. The chamber itself is excesivly crumbly, and likely no amount of gardening will make the chamber "safe", so if the pitch is dropped, decents should be very carefully made, one by one, with awareness on very possible falling rock.

#Question Mark Lists
#QM1	D	toto_to_crystalcrumble.11 -	A widening to the meander about halfway below the way into Crystal Crumble and the floor. Leads back towards Toto at a lower level to the way into Crystal Crumble. Probably not worth pursuing, definitly not until the floor of Toto has been dropped (as somewhwere from there probably leads to here).
#QM2	X	toto_to_crystalcrumble.10 -	The water flowing into Crystal Crumble almost certainly just flows along the rift from Liquid Luck. This really isn't worth pursuing.

#Cave Description
#After dropping Toto chamber to a large rock wedged mid way up, the main obvious way on is via a comfortably sized rift that quickly leads to a large, wet chamber. The ceiling seems high, and there are some pretty formations off to one side of the chamber (over to the right, looking in. We traversed over after a short absail). Unfortunatly, there seems to be no way on from here. Each end has a drippy/waterfall area, where the water drops down into a tight meander in the floor (partially covered by rockfall) that we could find no human sized way of accessing/bypassing. There is some widening to the meander used to access the chamber at a lower level (mid-way down), but this almost certainly just goes back to the true floor level of Toto and was not investigated. The area has been de-rigged and de-hanger'ed.

#Question Mark List
#QM1	A	ulysses_to_colericchamber.8 -	The water coming down one of the waterfalls goes into the floor and looks to head in the direction of the large space at the other side of the too-tight rift. One could either follow the water directly, or drop down from a few metres higher up through a hole in the floor, where you first drop into the chamber. It looks quite roomy down there, and with normal drippy water levels, it looks easy enough to stay dry.
#QM2	C	ulysses_to_colericchamber.6 -	To one side of the chamber is a tight rift, that has been reffered to as 'too-tight'. This leads to a large, echo'y space within sight. This is probably accessed via following the water below, but if the water goes elsewhere this is very worth checking out. A determined, brave, and thin individual could likely find a way through: although even this person may want a backup of some sort.

#Cave Description
# Traversing (with difficulty at the time of writing) around Ulysses leads to a small (compared to Ulysses), but comfortably traversable, rift. This almost immediatly drops into a tall chamber, with a dry waterfall and an active waterfall at one side and a too-tight rift at the other. Shouting into the too-tight rift produces a good echo, and no far wall can be seen! The water from the waterfall flows under the inital landing spot, and a comfortably sized continuation can be seen. This needs bolting and dropping, preferably staying far from the water: as it may get a lot more splashy in high water conditions. [So-called due to Stangrooms rage at the world.]

#------------
#Cave description  ;(leave commented-out)
#Starts with climbing sections over loose rock and a short traverse & pitch of 3m. Leads to a low crawl crossroads. This survey continues right where the passage size gradually increases passing several right turns (all lead to miracle maze) until it reaches large phreatic pssage with rift passage containing a small stream in the floor.

#Cave description  ;(leave commented-out)
# On last trip (derig) found large phreatic tube leading NE that continues but requires bolting a traverse. Below the traverse water could be spotted and waterfall could be heard (possible lead, likely miserable). Going back to the ledge that starts the survey and taking road south found cheese-level with multiple corridors that don't seem to connect immidiately. Multiple QMA left for next year (Rad 2018)

#Cave description  ;(leave commented-out)
#At junction turn left, ignore right and continue to cross roads. Left here soon ends in a mud-filled passage. Right was surveyed in kublakhan4. Continue in easy walking phreas. This ends with a rifty climb up to a complex chamber. Above is an aven with sound of water, could be climbed easily at least initially (QMA). Ahead the passage continues (QMA) and there is another lead below this (QMB).

#Cave description  ;(leave commented-out)
# Traverse the Nicolas cage handline then chimney down the rift and continue along the bottom of the rift, a tight area where you have to crawl along the floor before a 2m climb up you reach the top of Keanu breeze and Can't Stop japeing. The head of the pitch is to the left in a rift to give a nice Y hang. Straight ahead is a loose-looking hole that could be rigged as an alternative to the japery of can't stop japeing
