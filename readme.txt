The drawings repo holds all the CUCC expo cave drawings.

ACCESS 
- you can install the repository on your own computer. Instructions below and online advice here http://expo.survex.com/handbook/computing/repos.html
- alternatively, if you only want to access a single file this can possibly be downloaded directly from the website here https://expo.survex.com/dwgfiles/ and if you have problems try asking Phil Sarjent :-)

HISTORY 
- the drawings repo was originally called 'tunneldata' and was managed with mercurial. It was renamed 'drawings' when it was converted to git by Wookey
on 8th July 2019.

Install
-------
Choose a directory where you will keep 'drawings', and git clone 'drawings' into it using the following command:

git clone git://expo.survex.com/drawings
or more reliably
git clone ssh://expo@expo.survex.com/home/expo/drawings
