 "free text": "Welsh engineering was poorly rigged a week earlier, and we were informed it had not been surveyed.  Lucy (Book), James mca(paint), Zac (laser) returned to resruvey it. The survey was not tied in to radagast as the final link was planned on the way back. We were flood pulsed in the cave so also did not tie in at the bottom. We recorded 40 stations down to the start of eye of Sauron. The notes were recorded in a small red notebook, which I have not seen since Zac looked after them during the flood pulse. I believe Zac put them in a yellow tackle bag taken back to top camp and it is likely this was buried in the back away of top camp, which is a shame as there are a lot of mental notes I made during the sketch about things to note down when writing up the data/making the formal survey. Although it is not tied in it is still worthwhile entering this data as only one leg will be needed, from radagast, to tie in the survey, which begins with station \"2\"\" right at the entrance to the welsh engineering side tunnel. All survey stations were numbered in pink, so it will be very easy to tie in from radagast. All in all a frustrating trip, but I really want to get this survey done and entered as we worked hard on it.",
