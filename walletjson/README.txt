The wallets contents.json files
are now here, not in the expofiles/surveryscan folders
so that they are under git version control for safety

All automatic, users should be unaware of this.

The folder structure and filenames are identical to those in
expofiles/surveyscans/

PENDING
rename, e.g.
2001/2001#01/contents.json
as
2001/2001#01.json
