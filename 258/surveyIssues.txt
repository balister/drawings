This file is used to highlight possible issues with the 258 survey
turned up by AD whilst writing cave descriptions.

* End of Apfelstrudel: one way on in original survey notes, two
shown in survey. Speculate that the one way on leads to Dark
Fumblings and the other way might not exist.
* QM 07-06 B - passage to west near Stomach ULSA: does this
really exist? Original survey suggests two passages both going
to Stomach ULSA
* QM 08-21 – is there a pool here or a rock pillar
* oompah.4 – oompah.5: leg goes straight through a wall.
* toomuch.10 - toomuch.11: leg goes through wall.
* sovein.5 - sovein.6: leg goes through wall.
* maxpleasure3.16 - floor step shown in Tunnel, original notes
show ceiling height change.
* maxpleasure3.33 - missing QM (aven) 2007, unknown serial number
* maxpleasure3.29 - missing QM (C) 2007, unknown serial number
* QM 07-40 - suspect this is misplaced. Survey indicates survey 
near dubiouspleasure.6
* Aven QM labelled between delicious2.4 and 5. Original notes show 
ceiling height change on plan but nothing on elevation. Does this
aven exist?
* QM 06-05 - from description this appears to be in the same place
as a stream inlet marked on the Ducks on Ice survey near station 3,
or (less likely) the aven on the opposite side (depends on which
way "left" is).
* stonemonkey.2 - notes imply "small phreas" here - not marked as
QM. Is it QM or too tight?
* stonemonkey.17 - more ways on than shown on original survey - do
all of these exist?
* stonemonkey2.20 - pitch boundary in Tunnel, should be ceiling
height change.
* stonemonkey2.21 - "Nasty Rift" QM not marked. Passage heading west
probably doesn't exist (this is probably a representation of the
route in from stonemonkey2 shown on the stonemonkey3 survey).
* stonemonkey2/stonemonkey3: pitch boundary lines for c4 and c5 are
wrong way round (based on elevations)
* stonemonkey3.11 - elevation shows 4m pitch down - should this be
a QM (no indication of descent)?
* stonemonkey3/stonemonkey4 - three pitches shown, where stonemonkey4
notes suggest only 2
