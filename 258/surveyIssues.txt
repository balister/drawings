This file is used to highlight possible issues with the 258 survey
turned up by AD whilst writing cave descriptions.

* End of Apfelstrudel: one way on in original survey notes, two
shown in survey. Speculate that the one way on leads to Dark
Fumblings and the other way might not exist.
* QM 07-06 B - passage to west near Stomach ULSA: does this
really exist? Original survey suggests two passages both going
to Stomach ULSA
* QM 08-21 – is there a pool here or a rock pillar
* oompah.4 – oompah.5: leg goes straight through a wall.
* toomuch.10 - toomuch.11: leg goes through wall.
* sovein.5 - sovein.6: leg goes through wall.
