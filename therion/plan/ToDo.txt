Things that need Fixing
=======================
Sketching
---------

The join between the window from Ropeless and the Oldroute (top_intooldrift in 107ent3.th2 and pitch2_bottom in 107oldroute.th2)

Bit between the p10 and the "p100" - not been visited since 1978, and poorly sketched by Jenny from above (top100 in 107oldroute.th2)

oldroute2 in 107oldoute.th2 has quite a lot of distortion, and a relatively poor loop closure - check for data entry errors

The "p67" (now eastern p72) - no sketch so somewhat made up, need to show old ledge  (p67 in 107oldroute.th2)

Poorly placed labels in Old Route

Make the Too Bold pitch be transparent so you can see into China. For some reason the usual -outline in -clip off wont behave (scary_trav in 107opeless.th2)

Pit line along boulder at N end of China (near Tibet) - should it be removed, or reversed

QM pit just south of SSB marked on sketch never got allocated a number

Join near top of Korea isn't right (aven_warp, loc_main)

improve green/yellow join in ropeless

Check all QM labels in Old Route have been added

Check all QMs that need removing have been

Improve scrap joins in Last TSA

Stop mud and sand from being visible under rocks in Last TSA

Improve coldest-double beep, and coldest-notwindow joins

Redraw SSB

Update elevation

Draw passage cross-sections


Making the map look Pretty
--------------------------

Sort out label sizes better (i.e. dont just use two different sizes for everything, and make the more important labels larger)

Add grid (if it looks useful)

Add more text to legend (Coord system, Explored and surveyed by CUCC 1978, 2012-2015, Survey grade,...)

Add that it is grid north to the north arrow

Add rose diagram of passage azimuth weight by leg length (if it looks useful)
