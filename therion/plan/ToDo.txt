Things that need Fixing
=======================
Sketching
---------

The join between the window from Ropeless and the Oldroute (top_intooldrift in 107ent3.th2 and pitch2_bottom in 107oldroute.th2)

Bit between the p10 and the "p100" - not been visited since 1978, and poorly sketched by Jenny from above (top100 in 107oldroute.th2)

oldroute2 in 107oldoute.th2 has quite a lot of distortion, and a relatively poor loop closure - check for data entry errors

The "p67" (now eastern p72) - no sketch so somewhat made up, need to show old ledge  (p67 in 107oldroute.th2)

Pit line along boulder at N end of China (near Tibet) - should it be removed, or reversed

Passage heading off at N end of China (west of Tibet) - should this be changed to an alcove?

improve green/yellow join in ropeless

Improve scrap joins in Last TSA

Stop mud and sand from being visible under rocks in Last TSA

Improve coldest-double beep, and coldest-notwindow joins

Update elevation

Draw passage cross-sections


Making the map look Pretty
--------------------------

Add grid (if it looks useful)

Add more text to legend (Coord system, Explored and surveyed by CUCC 1978, 2012-2015, Survey grade,...)

Add that it is grid north to the north arrow

Add rose diagram of passage azimuth weight by leg length (if it looks useful)
